    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Once again, I tried to predict the future based off a model and an addition of basketball knowledge with human interference. Our group&rsquo;s model stayed pretty basic, using offensive and defensive efficiency, rebounds and shooting statistics.
Unlike the March Madness models, we were allowed to distrust our models. We intervened rarely, usually factoring in if a star player was returning or sitting out. As a group we would look at previous games, the series record and who was hot on both teams.
As a group we went 7-6 so had a winning percentage, however one of our six losses was a majority of our money on the last day which sent us to the bottom.
This project taught me that modeling with certain factors got some predictions way closer than most would expect. As far as gambling? Don&rsquo;t. It turns out professional athletes aren&rsquo;t as consistent or reliable as some claim them to be. This project overall was enjoyable and showed me there is a thought process behind these short term investment opportunities</p>
